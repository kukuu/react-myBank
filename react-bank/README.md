# React Bank

A complete banking application

Dependencies:

1. create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).  

2. Routing implemented using [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router).

3. State management using [redux](redux.js.org).  Also uses [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) to make things look good :sparkles:

API project uses a fake REST API [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). Substitute with yours

## Getting Started

Open a terminal / command prompt and run the ``` setup.sh ``` file to install node packages.

The above installs the node dependencies for the main package.json file, along
with dependencies for the API and UI projects.

Start the application:

``` npm start ```

The above will start the UI on port 3000 and start the API on port 3001.

Enjoy!
